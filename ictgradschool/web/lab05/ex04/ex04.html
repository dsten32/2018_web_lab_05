    Technology is one of New Zealand’s fastest growing industries, and our third largest export earner. As a
    result there’s a huge demand for ICT graduates who can hit the ground running. That’s where the Auckland ICT
    Graduate School comes in. In a collaboration between the University of Auckland and the University of
    Waikato, we’ve created two postgraduate programmes to develop smart, industry-ready ICT graduates who will
    meet this need.

                career in ICT.</p>

            <p>It’s difficult to think of a business area that doesn’t rely on ICT, and ICT capability is integral to
                business success. ICT is the fastest growing industry in New Zealand, and businesses demand employees
                who have the skills to help drive this growth.</p>

                short,
                intensive programme is ideal for those who already have an undergraduate degree in a non ICT-related
                subject, and offers a supercharged route into the industry.</p>

            <p>You’ll gain fundamental skills in software development, including up-to-date knowledge of object-oriented
                programming and design, web technologies and databases, which will complement your existing critical
                thinking and communication abilities.</p>

                <h5>Programming for Industry</h5>

                This course introduces object-oriented software development, which is the dominant paradigm for
                developing software in the IT industry. Using the Java programming language, Programming for
                Industry covers the key principles of object-oriented programming, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism
                and composition, in addition to fundamental modelling and design techniques. Students will develop
                application software of moderate complexity, and in doing so learn how to apply object-oriented
                principles and use contemporary application programming interfaces, frameworks and tools.

                <h5>Programming with Web Technologies</h5>

                This course complements Programming for Industry by focusing on the development of web-based
                applications, which are hugely prevalent in the modern world. Knowledge of design principles and
                technologies for web-based applications, coupled with associated practical skills, are invaluable to
                individuals intending to work in the IT industry. This course introduces the key client-side
                technologies HTML, CSS and Javascript, as well as server-side technologies to support dynamic web
                pages and relational database access. Students will also learn about the usability of web-based user
                interfaces, and the use of mobile apps in a web application.
