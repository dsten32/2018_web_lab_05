    <h1>Join one of the fastest growing industries in the world</h1>

    Technology is one of New Zealand’s fastest growing industries, and our third largest export earner. As a
    result there’s a huge demand for ICT graduates who can hit the ground running. That’s where the Auckland ICT
    Graduate School comes in. In a collaboration between the University of Auckland and the University of
    Waikato, we’ve created two postgraduate programmes to develop smart, industry-ready ICT graduates who will
    meet this need.

    <!--add bootstrap classes to the 2 child divs inside the 'row' div to make them bootstrap columns -->
    <!--make the columns responsive so that on a smaller screen they will only be a single column rather than two adjacent columns-->
    <!--add appropriate bootstrap classes and divs to make all of the content display correctly, this will include making the vertical nav-->

            <h2>Postgraduate Certificate in Information Technology</h2>
            <br>

            <h4>Kick-start your ICT career</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Designed for students with a non ICT-related bachelors degree, our Postgraduate Certificate in
                Information Technology (PGCertInfoTech) will teach you the specialist skills you need to ignite your
                career in ICT.</p>

            <p>It’s difficult to think of a business area that doesn’t rely on ICT, and ICT capability is integral to
                business success. ICT is the fastest growing industry in New Zealand, and businesses demand employees
                who have the skills to help drive this growth.</p>

            <p>If you’ve ever considered working in the ICT sector, the PGCertInfoTech is the programme for you. The
                short,
                intensive programme is ideal for those who already have an undergraduate degree in a non ICT-related
                subject, and offers a supercharged route into the industry.</p>

            <p>You’ll gain fundamental skills in software development, including up-to-date knowledge of object-oriented
                programming and design, web technologies and databases, which will complement your existing critical
                thinking and communication abilities.</p>
